SpriteImp
=========

Those pesky sprite imps are here to help you with all your spriting needs. At least they say they want to help...

This is quite heavily under development and not usable yet.

Planned features:
* Textures (for getting pixel data)
* Sprites
* Bounding box collision
* Pixel collision
* Frame animations
* Tweening?

SpriteImp will be bundled as a part of Lyria, but can be used without it as well.
